Twitter Sentiment Analysis for Greek Tweets regarding Immigration

This repository is used for showing code I personally created regarding my thesis. The Thesis has the title "Targeted Sentiment 
Analysis on Immigration in Greek Society" and is being carried out under the supervision of K.G. Margaritis, a professor at 
the University of Macedonia.

The code is organized into folders, each with a name explaining its use. Each file is a Python script with part of the functionality
necessary.

All the .txt data are versions of the data that will be used for this analysis.
