I  thought that I had paid and wanted to get inside. However the  bus driver called me and asked me in an impolite way if the coins  were stuck at the opening of the box. He had not seen me paying  and there wasn't a stack of coins in the box. I could not  understand this and the driver kept questioning me.

When I met my classmates and friends I told them the  good news. I was so happy that I could not concentrate on my  studies."
fear,A boy phoned me at night and wanted to talk to me for minutes  outside. I thought that he would reveal what he felt and would  question me on our relationship.

However I could not apologize, so I pretended that  nothing had happened and smiled when I left. My friend did not  say anything but just watched me leave."

fear,"It was a week before the higher level results were announced. I  had tried and failed many times and this was the last time that  I was taking the exam. I knew that if i failed again I woulld  have to enter the society. I imagined things during this period  - I dreamt that I had entered university and it was a nice  experience. When I thought about the future, an unexplainable  fear rose in me. I feared being a worker and not having a bright  prospect, I also feared the criticism of my relatives as my  brother had gone to university. Whenevr I thought of this issue  I could not eat or concentrate, and my heart beat increased."

disgust,"At hostel, my roommate was a very selfish person and would avoid  doing anyhting that did not concern him. A few of us prepared lunch  together and had decided to share the work. My roomate had  promised to do the same but I had to wash the bowls everytime  after dinner. I tried to wait and thought that he would realize  his fault. I did not want to tell him to do the work as he is a  university student and ought to have self-respect. He  disappointed me and so every time I saw him I tried to avoid him  and did not want to keep any contact with him."
joy,"In August,, the long awaited \big envelope\"" (a document for  C.U.H.K admission) arrived. It was in the afternoon and I had  not been doing anything.

It lasted several hours and only calmed down later."""
fear,"On Christmas eve,, I had just finished the exams and was  afraid as the results of one of my major subjects had been very  unsatisfactory. I thought that I had only a % chance of  passing. Even if I failed this subject I would not need to  repeat. However I liked this subject very much and my results  were bad because of my lazyness. If I was forced to change to a  minor in this subject I would be very unwilling."
anger,"In September , I was forced to live with someone I did not  like. The first week we were at loggerheads and our conversation  was like a debate. The atmosphere was very bad. When he learnt  that I had got marks in a test he told me \ A failure, You lost  marks.\"" I was very angry, not because my marks were lower  than his, but because I could not tolerate his pride. I did not  show my discontentment and carried on doing my work."""
sadness,This issue worried me rather than saddening me. In mid September  I went to Guanggho alone. I was looking for an accomodation in  the evening and after having walked or miles I still could not  find anything. What could I do? I was not worried about  sleeping on the streets but because of some procedural problems.  I finally found a place to sleep at o'clock.
disgust,"My roommate liked to listen to some meaningless songs which had  melody but had no content. We lived together so when he played  the recorder I was forced to listen to them.

anger,Two years back someone invited me to be the tutor of her  grand-daughter. The grand-daughter asked me some questions in  mathematics so I taught her. However she did not listen to me  and this made me feel unhappy. The second year it was the same.  When I entered university the girl's parents suggested that I be  employed as their daghters tutor. They told me that at university  there was no homework and I would have a lot of time so they  made a time-table for me which required me to be the tutor five  days a week. They did not respect me and anyway I had another  child to teach.
sadness,I had taken the responsibility to do something and I had  prepared for it. However I failed because of my timidity. After  three attempts I still could not adapt to the atmosphere and  failed as before. I felt imcompetent and felt that the others  would think that I had not prepared for it.
disgust,I was at home and I heard a loud sound of spitting outside the  door. I thought that one of my family members would step on the spit  and bring the germs in the house.
